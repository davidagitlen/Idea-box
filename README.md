# IdeaBox Redux
## Project with David Gitlen, Jacob Ogren and Allison Wagner

### Summary

IdeaBox was our third project of Module One at the Turing School of Software and Design. Throughout the project, our 
focus was on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. 


For the user, IdeaBox Redux is an app that allows a user to create a great idea, title it, describe the idea in the 
body and it save it to the page. As the ideas gather, the user can increase or decrease the quality of each idea and 
filter through them based on qualities they give them. There is also a search filter so that the user can find an idea 
by title or body. Even further, the user can only show the ideas that have “starred” as their favorites. In between uses, 
the ideas are saved to the page and persist upon refresh. If the user no longer likes an idea, they can delete it and 
it will be removed from the page.


For the developer, IdeaBox Redux was excellent practice on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the 
browser, localStorage and JSON to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions. As well as creating a visual pleasing 
site for our user with HTML and CSS. Concepts include iterating through arrays, working with object oriented 
programming, event bubbling and event delegation, and practice with grid and flexbox.
